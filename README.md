### Why LkEngine?
When I began writing **LukkelEngine** I had lots to learn about graphics and engines (I still do),
which in turn put lots of initial focus into things such as 3D objects and applying physics on them.
This caused some flaws in the base design that I wasn't too happy with.<br>
<br>
Therefore focus will not be directly targeted towards 3D rendering and physics but towards 
2D instead.<br>
This is done to create a better base to expand on in the future.
A better and more refined design on user interactability that **LukkelEngine** lacked.<br>
<br>
When the 2D implementation is done, the goal is to create a game such as *Super Mario* or *Pokémon* in a 2D fashion,
mostly using sprites.
