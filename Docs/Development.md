Once again thanks to my best friend **Atilla** for his handsome face. I need to add new images for the *Create Menu* (what I call it for now) 
but Atilla's beauty will do for now.

### February 15

Last couple of weeks has mostly been work on assets and asset loading. <br>
Some nice improvements can be seen though, especially with the new environment cubemap.

### February 4

Faulty renderered mesh because of a misaligned vertexbuffer and shader layout.

### December 4
It has been a while since I last posted some progress.<br>
What's new is that I've added functionality to pass textures to draw calls for 2D rendering 
which can be seen in the images below :smile:.<br>
(sincere thanks to Atilla for being my debugging texture)

### October 29

Rendering lines and quads using the new 2D renderer.

<br>

### October 20

Rendered entities that consist of mesh, sprite and transform components. The UI has been improved.

<br>

### October 16

Got a base UI layout going with two rectangles that can be moved and have their colors changed.

![2023-October-16-1](Images/2023/LkEngine-2023-10-16_1.png)

<br>

Rendering multiple rectangles that can be adjusted indivually thanks to the entity component system.
The entity entries can be seen on the right sidebar.

## March 2023
### March 19
Improved the UI, added constraints and updated the event handling.<br>
Not happy with the physics implementation, will redo it in the future.

Colliding objects are set to the color black whenever a valid detection takes place.

The cyan cube has a pivot constraint that can be added and removed with the UI (constraints menu to the left).
